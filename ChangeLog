This is a ChangeLog file for the Modem::Vgetty Perl module.

Sun Aug 23 21:40:08 CEST 1998

Added the readnum method to the module and its description to the
manual page (section Examples). Created the "examples" directory
as well as the two sample scripts in it.

Added a readnum routine to the examples in the POD. Still need to
create an examples/ directory. The readnum() should probably be
added to the main module as the Modem::Vgetty::readnum() method.

Changed the spelling in the second example; the Czech word "cesta" has
been changed to its English equivalent "path".


Wed Jul 22 13:27:29 MET DST 1998 by kas 

Fixed the docs of some event types (as suggested by Marc Eberhard):
RECEIVE_DTMF, SILENCE_DETECTED and NO_VOICE_ENERGY.


Wed Jul 22 13:01:16 MET DST 1998 by kas 

Removed the ugly sleep(20) from the Quick Start example. This example
now uses SIGALRM instead.


Wed Jul 22 12:57:39 MET DST 1998 by kas 

Changed the primary location of the mgetty/vgetty sources to
alpha.greenie.net.

Mon Jul 20 17:46:30 CEST 1998
Initial release.
